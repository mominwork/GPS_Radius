First of all, I would like to say that it was not easy to complete 
a task using technologies in which I have little experience. But I 
have an insatiable thirst when it comes to knowledge. Also, the extent 
of passion that I have for programming along with reading as my favorite 
hobby helped me a lot to complete the assignment. The problem I faced 
at first is that google maps was a novel technology for me. It is easier 
for me to solve problems in C++ or Java which I am familiar with. But to 
create a complete app was difficult where designing the interface 
andassociate the codes with it need to be done at the same place. 
I had to learn the google map template libraries and usage of the 
library functions. The problem I faced next was designing the interface 
and displaying it on the screen. I had to go through several example 
codes that were provided by google and learn the commands. Next, I 
searched about how I can limit the results within user radius. But 
above all, the biggest problem for me was to display place results 
corresponding to the specific users.  I think about the solution to 
this problem for long and finally realized that this problem can be 
solved by using nested “for” loops. Once I have learned the logic 
behind the solution to the problem, if was not very difficult for me 
to implement the code. Also, I didn’t have experience in using Github. 
I had to learn how repositories are created and how codes can be 
uploaded to the repositories.
